# Kalculator
A Calculator app in C# built using Unity3d.

This is a calculator app that is yet to be finished. I'll need some help from awesome programmers to complete it!

## There are some features that I already made myself:
- Inputting Numbers. (0 - 9)
- A scrollable and dynamically sized display.
- A working implementation of decimal points.
- Basic functions. (Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division)

### Note: Before attempting to add new features, issues need to be fixed. Also, always create new branches and Pull Requests.
**__ Only the c# script found at /Assets/Scripts/BasicHandler.cs needs to be modified. __**
